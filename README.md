# Basic Calculator Program

## Description
This is a simple Python program that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). The program prompts the user to input two numbers and a mathematical operator, then calculates and displays the result.

## Features
- Supports addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and division (`/`).
- Takes user input for both numbers and the operation.
- Displays the result in a formatted manner.
- Handles basic error checking (e.g., division by zero).

## How to Run the Program
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your computer (Python 3.x recommended).
2. Download or copy the `calculator.py` script to your local machine.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the directory containing the script.
5. Run the program using the command:
   ```bash
   python calculator.py
   ```
6. Follow the on-screen instructions to enter two numbers and an operator.

## Example Usage
```
Enter first number: 10
Enter second number: 5
Enter operation (+, -, *, /): +
Result: 10 + 5 = 15
```

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

## Error Handling
- If the user inputs an invalid operator, the program will prompt for a valid input.
- Division by zero is handled gracefully with an error message.

## Future Improvements
- Implement a graphical user interface (GUI).
- Allow multiple operations in a single input.
- Enhance input validation and exception handling.
